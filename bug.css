The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to specificity and inheritance:

```css
.container {
  font-size: 16px;
}

.container p {
  font-size: 18px; /* This will override .container's font-size */
}

.container .special-paragraph {
  font-size: 14px; /* This will override .container p's font-size */
}

.container p.special-paragraph {
  font-size: 12px; /* This will NOT override the previous declaration.  The order in which the selectors are written doesn't directly cause this */
}
```

The unexpected behavior occurs because the selector `.container p.special-paragraph` has the same specificity as `.container .special-paragraph`.  Despite being declared later, it does *not* override the previous declaration.
