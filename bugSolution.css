The issue can be resolved in several ways:

1. **Increase Specificity:** Add more specificity to the selector that needs to override by adding an extra selector, such as an ID. 

```css
#specialParagraph {
  font-size: 12px;
}
```

2. **Adjust declaration order:** While generally not recommended as it is less maintainable, rearranging the order of CSS rules in a stylesheet such that the most specific rule is declared last will ensure that the correct rule is applied.

```css
.container {
  font-size: 16px;
}

.container p {
  font-size: 18px; 
}

.container .special-paragraph {
  font-size: 14px; 
}

.container p.special-paragraph {
  font-size: 12px; /* Now overrides since the selector is more specific than .container .special-paragraph*/
}
```

3. **Use !important:** Using `!important` is generally discouraged because it overrides the cascade system, but is useful in exceptional cases.

```css
.container p.special-paragraph {
  font-size: 12px !important; 
}
```
Choose the method that best suits your project's style and maintainability. The first solution, increasing specificity, is usually the preferred approach.
